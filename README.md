# FRAMED 


## Project Description 

This is a project called ***Framed***, a name seeming appropriate for a photography website. The project author ***Kyle Mwendwa***. 
Framed is a collection of my favourite experiences captured through photos and is a way for me to reminisce on the adventures that 
are captured in it. Needless to say, the project has achieved its purpose with its simplistic yet attractive design that projects 
the pictures within it as more than just pictures, but monumental **moments** or **memories**.
>"Sometimes, you will never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory." — Dr. Seuss
