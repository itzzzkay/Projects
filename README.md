# FRAMED


## Project Description ##

This is a project called Framed, a name seeming appropriaate for a photography website. The project author Kyle Mwendwa. 
Framed is a collection of my favourite experiences captured through photos and is a way for me to reminisce on the adventures that 
are captured in it. Needless to say, the project has achieved its purpose with its simplistic yet attractive design that projects 
the pictures within it as more than just pictures, but monumental moments or memories.
